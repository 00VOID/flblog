# Welcome to the Forbidden Lands

The night is a bitter, relentless reminder of the harshness of the Forbidden Lands. Cold rain pours down in sheets, driven by a fierce wind that howls through the skeletal trees and barren rocks. The ground is a quagmire, a mix of mud and sodden leaves, where every step is a struggle. The campfire, a feeble beacon of warmth and light, sputters and hisses as the rain tries to extinguish it, but it stubbornly clings to life. Its flickering glow casts long shadows, creating fleeting, ghostly shapes that dance at the edge of the darkness.

The group huddles close to the fire, their clothes soaked through, their breath visible in the cold air. The flames offer scant warmth, but it’s enough to stave off the worst of the chill. The smell of wet earth and damp wood fills the air, mixing with the faint, acrid scent of smoke. Their faces are lined with exhaustion, eyes reflecting the weariness of a hard journey.

In the past 24 hours, they’ve endured a grueling trek through unforgiving terrain. They’ve been forced off the main paths by a roaming band of orcs, their guttural laughter and the clinking of their weapons echoing through the forest, making travel on the main roads too dangerous. Forced to take less traveled, more treacherous routes, the group navigated narrow trails that wound through dense thickets and over rocky outcrops.

A sudden, heavy downpour caught them unprepared, turning the ground to mud and making every step a battle. They struggled to find a dry spot to camp, their progress slowed by the relentless rain and the weight of their sodden gear. Supplies have been damaged, and morale is low. The constant threat of ambushes from lurking creatures or hostile patrols has kept them on edge, sleep fleeting and fitful at best.

As they sit around the fire, the crackle of the flames mingles with the distant, eerie calls of nocturnal creatures. One of them, perhaps the most perceptive or anxious, glances over their shoulder, eyes searching the darkness. Was that a movement? The rustling of leaves? The night is full of unseen dangers, and every shadow holds the promise of something lurking, watching, waiting.

In the light of the fire, they exchange glances, silently acknowledging the hardship of their journey. But in the flicker of the flames, there is also a glimmer of determination. They’ve survived another day in the Forbidden Lands, and though the future is uncertain, they have each other and the resolve to face whatever comes next.
