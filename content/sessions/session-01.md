The party stagger through the dense, dark forest, their breaths coming in ragged gasps after narrowly surviving an ambush. The cold rain continues to pour, soaking them to the bone and turning the ground into a treacherous mire. As they catch their breath, they rummage through their provisions only to find them rotten and waterlogged. Hunger gnaws at their bellies, and the chill of the night bites into their bones.

One of their party lies gravely wounded, his blood staining the muddy ground. They manage to give him some water, which sustains him just long enough for him to gasp out a direction. “The Hollows… south,” he whispers, pointing a trembling hand. With no other options and their friend’s life hanging by a thread, they set off towards the village.

Their journey south is a grueling test of endurance and survival. Each step is a struggle, their progress hampered by exhaustion and the relentless rain. They make camp when they can, finding what little provisions the forest offers, and press on with varying degrees of success. Eventually, their tired eyes catch sight of The Hollows, a small beacon of hope amid the oppressive wilderness.

At the village gate, they are met by the gatekeeper, a stern figure who eyes them suspiciously. After they explain their dire situation, he softens slightly and ushers them inside. The gatekeeper gives them a rough lay of the village, pointing them towards the chapel where they might find help for their deceased companion.

Inside the chapel, they meet Alaric, the village priest. He seems remarkably unflustered by the sight of a near-dead body. With practiced efficiency, he directs the party to place their wounded friend in the cold storage beneath the chapel. Alaric makes some strange comments about locking the doors to prevent anyone from “going walkabout,” his words tinged with an unsettling air of familiarity with death. Leaving their friend in Alaric’s care, the party makes their way to the local tavern, The Three Skulls.

The tavern is a dimly lit refuge filled with the murmur of low conversations and the thick haze of smoke. Yawim, the burly brewmaster, greets them with suspicion when seeing a short member of the party with a beard - apparently the OBVIOUS dwarven barkeep has banned dwarves from his tavern. He offers them lodgings and a much-needed respite from their harrowing journey. As they settle in, a random drunk local shares eerie tales of ringing bells to welcome the dead, and the strange customs of the village, adding to the uneasy atmosphere.

After a night of fitful sleep, the adventurers wake to the aroma of a simple breakfast. As they eat, Yawim approaches them, his demeanor animated and overt. He proposes a bold plan: assassinate Mrs. Pollmor, the village elder, who is taxing his business into the ground. He promises a substantial reward for their service. Just as he lays out his offer, Yawim’s wife intervenes, scolding him and shooing him away.

Yawim hurries off, leaving the adventurers to ponder their next move as they finish their breakfast. The session ends with the party contemplating the weight of Yawim’s proposal and the dangerous path that lies ahead in The Hollows.
