The party stagger through the dense, dark forest, their breaths coming in ragged gasps after narrowly surviving an ambush. The cold rain continues to pour, soaking them to the bone and turning the ground into a treacherous mire. As they catch their breath, they rummage through their provisions only to find them rotten and waterlogged. Hunger gnaws at their bellies, and the chill of the night bites into their bones.

One of their party lies gravely wounded, his blood staining the muddy ground. They manage to give him some water, which sustains him just long enough for him to gasp out a direction. “The Hollows… south,” he whispers, pointing a trembling hand. With no other options and their friend’s life hanging by a thread, they set off towards the village.

Their journey south is a grueling test of endurance and survival. Each step is a struggle, their progress hampered by exhaustion and the relentless rain. They make camp when they can, finding what little provisions the forest offers, and press on with varying degrees of success. Eventually, their tired eyes catch sight of The Hollows, a small beacon of hope amid the oppressive wilderness.

At the village gate, they are met by the gatekeeper, a stern figure who eyes them suspiciously. After they explain their dire situation, he softens slightly and ushers them inside. The gatekeeper gives them a rough lay of the village, pointing them towards the chapel where they might find help for their deceased companion.

Inside the chapel, they meet Alaric, the village priest. He seems remarkably unflustered by the sight of a near-dead body. With practiced efficiency, he directs the party to place their wounded friend in the cold storage beneath the chapel. Alaric makes some strange comments about locking the doors to prevent anyone from “going walkabout,” his words tinged with an unsettling air of familiarity with death. Leaving their friend in Alaric’s care, the party makes their way to the local tavern, The Three Skulls.

The tavern is a dimly lit refuge filled with the murmur of low conversations and the thick haze of smoke. Yawim, the burly brewmaster, greets them with suspicion when seeing a short member of the party with a beard - apparently the OBVIOUS dwarven barkeep has banned dwarves from his tavern. He offers them lodgings and a much-needed respite from their harrowing journey. As they settle in, a random drunk local shares eerie tales of ringing bells to welcome the dead, and the strange customs of the village, adding to the uneasy atmosphere.

After a night of fitful sleep, the adventurers wake to the aroma of a simple breakfast. As they eat, Yawim approaches them, his demeanor animated and overt. He proposes a bold plan: assassinate Mrs. Pollmor, the village elder, who is taxing his business into the ground. He promises a substantial reward for their service. Just as he lays out his offer, Yawim’s wife intervenes, scolding him and shooing him away.

Yawim hurries off, leaving the adventurers to ponder their next move as they finish their breakfast. The session ends with the party contemplating the weight of Yawim’s proposal and the dangerous path that lies ahead in The Hollows.

The party found themselves in the village of The Hollows, seated at the inn. Yahwim, the village brewmaster, who had granted them lodging, seemed particularly agitated. Over breakfast, Yahwim shared his frustration about the village's future. The village elder, Mrs. Pollmor, wished to maintain the status quo and keep the village isolated, while Yahwim envisioned turning the village into a bustling trade hub. This had led to tensions, with Mrs. Pollmor suggesting Yahwim should pay taxes for his profits from trading his fantastical brews.

After breakfast, the adventurers decided to explore the old cemetery, known for its eerie atmosphere. Mid-morning, they approached the overgrown and neglected graveyard. The cemetery was in a state of disrepair, with crumbling walls, toppled headstones, and overgrown crypts. Aran, intrigued by the desolation, searched for any signs of recent activity but found none. The cemetery felt forgotten, with no recent visitors and no edible fungus much to Aran’s dismay.

Amidst the exploration, Bomtom recalled a play about an old count entombed alive for rebelling against a king allied with evil powers. This tragic tale seemed to resonate with the graveyard's atmosphere. Further inspection revealed an ancient, sealed doorway carved into the rock, suggesting hidden secrets below.

As they left the cemetery, they were approached by Sturkas, a tall, gaunt figure with a yellow and red cloak and a staff. Introducing himself as a member of the Rust Brotherhood, he warned the adventurers about interfering with Yahwim's plans and maintaining the village's delicate balance. His demeanour suggested an underlying threat, despite his polite words.

The adventurers assured Sturkas they had no intention of causing trouble, and after a brief conversation, they parted ways, with Sturkas heading towards the northern side of the village in an unnervingly quick fashion, moving faster than one would expect from a man of his stature.

The party then climbed to the Temple of Fingers, an ancient open-air structure on a hilltop. The temple consisted of a circular plinth with pillars forming a skeletal dome over it. In the center lay a toppled obelisk, which Aran noticed bore an inscription. After deciphering it, they learned that during the full moon's midnight hour, the obelisk would reveal the path to Nepola's final resting place. Realising the obelisk needed to be upright to function correctly, they planned to return and raise it during the next full moon. Whilst his fellow party members investigated the structure Aran resumed his quest for edible fungus but again to no avail.

Hungry and tired, the party headed to the Dead Man's Hand, a more traditional inn compared to the Three Skulls. They enjoyed a hearty meal of grilled boar and mediocre ale, with Bomtom offering to perform in the evening. However, the barkeep, Olm, politely declined, suggesting a potential future opportunity.

Leaving the inn, they encountered Perko, a simpleton boy with wild hair and mismatched eyes, kicking dirt near the tavern. Aran offered Perko some leftover boar meat, which he devoured eagerly. In return, Perko handed Aran a decomposed bird from his pocket, a strange and unsettling gesture. Villagers warned them not to feed Perko, as he would become a persistent nuisance.

The adventurers visited the local blacksmith, a burly man named Ness, who offered to sharpen their weapons. Bomtom sold a spare dagger for a couple of copper coins, while Ness shared his views on the village's trade disputes. He preferred the village's self-sufficient nature and was wary of changes that could disrupt their way of life.

As dusk approached, they headed to the chapel, where Father Elric awaited with their deceased comrade's body prepared for burial. They followed him to the new cemetery, a well-kept and serene place, unlike the old graveyard. After a brief ceremony, Elric performed a final ritual involving a small shrine for the Nightwalker, an ancient protector deity. The ritual concluded, and the priest hurried back to the village, leaving the adventurers to reflect on the day's events.

Returning to the Dead Man's Hand, the inn was now bustling with evening patrons. They noticed an elderly woman in the previously unoccupied rocking chair by the fire, and Sturkas sitting alone in a shadowy corner. Ordering wine instead of the inn's poor ale, they settled in, ready to discuss their next moves and the mysteries surrounding The Hollows.
