The party found themselves in the village of The Hollows, seated at the inn. Yahwim, the village brewmaster, who had granted them lodging, seemed particularly agitated. Over breakfast, Yahwim shared his frustration about the village's future. The village elder, Mrs. Pollmor, wished to maintain the status quo and keep the village isolated, while Yahwim envisioned turning the village into a bustling trade hub. This had led to tensions, with Mrs. Pollmor suggesting Yahwim should pay taxes for his profits from trading his fantastical brews.

After breakfast, the adventurers decided to explore the old cemetery, known for its eerie atmosphere. Mid-morning, they approached the overgrown and neglected graveyard. The cemetery was in a state of disrepair, with crumbling walls, toppled headstones, and overgrown crypts. Aran, intrigued by the desolation, searched for any signs of recent activity but found none. The cemetery felt forgotten, with no recent visitors and no edible fungus much to Aranâ€™s dismay.

Amidst the exploration, Bomtom recalled a play about an old count entombed alive for rebelling against a king allied with evil powers. This tragic tale seemed to resonate with the graveyard's atmosphere. Further inspection revealed an ancient, sealed doorway carved into the rock, suggesting hidden secrets below.

As they left the cemetery, they were approached by Sturkas, a tall, gaunt figure with a yellow and red cloak and a staff. Introducing himself as a member of the Rust Brotherhood, he warned the adventurers about interfering with Yahwim's plans and maintaining the village's delicate balance. His demeanour suggested an underlying threat, despite his polite words.

The adventurers assured Sturkas they had no intention of causing trouble, and after a brief conversation, they parted ways, with Sturkas heading towards the northern side of the village in an unnervingly quick fashion, moving faster than one would expect from a man of his stature.

The party then climbed to the Temple of Fingers, an ancient open-air structure on a hilltop. The temple consisted of a circular plinth with pillars forming a skeletal dome over it. In the center lay a toppled obelisk, which Aran noticed bore an inscription. After deciphering it, they learned that during the full moon's midnight hour, the obelisk would reveal the path to Nepola's final resting place. Realising the obelisk needed to be upright to function correctly, they planned to return and raise it during the next full moon. Whilst his fellow party members investigated the structure Aran resumed his quest for edible fungus but again to no avail.

Hungry and tired, the party headed to the Dead Man's Hand, a more traditional inn compared to the Three Skulls. They enjoyed a hearty meal of grilled boar and mediocre ale, with Bomtom offering to perform in the evening. However, the barkeep, Olm, politely declined, suggesting a potential future opportunity.

Leaving the inn, they encountered Perko, a simpleton boy with wild hair and mismatched eyes, kicking dirt near the tavern. Aran offered Perko some leftover boar meat, which he devoured eagerly. In return, Perko handed Aran a decomposed bird from his pocket, a strange and unsettling gesture. Villagers warned them not to feed Perko, as he would become a persistent nuisance.

The adventurers visited the local blacksmith, a burly man named Ness, who offered to sharpen their weapons. Bomtom sold a spare dagger for a couple of copper coins, while Ness shared his views on the village's trade disputes. He preferred the village's self-sufficient nature and was wary of changes that could disrupt their way of life.

As dusk approached, they headed to the chapel, where Father Elric awaited with their deceased comrade's body prepared for burial. They followed him to the new cemetery, a well-kept and serene place, unlike the old graveyard. After a brief ceremony, Elric performed a final ritual involving a small shrine for the Nightwalker, an ancient protector deity. The ritual concluded, and the priest hurried back to the village, leaving the adventurers to reflect on the day's events.

Returning to the Dead Man's Hand, the inn was now bustling with evening patrons. They noticed an elderly woman in the previously unoccupied rocking chair by the fire, and Sturkas sitting alone in a shadowy corner. Ordering wine instead of the inn's poor ale, they settled in, ready to discuss their next moves and the mysteries surrounding The Hollows.
