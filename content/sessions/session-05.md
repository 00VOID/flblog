In the secluded village of the Hollows, the fragile peace has shattered like glass. Once a place of quietude, the village is now a powder keg ready to explode. The day had begun with festivities—laughter, ale, and the simple joys of a rural celebration. But beneath the veneer of merriment, old tensions simmered, waiting for a spark.

Bomtom, ever cautious yet eager to participate, senses something amiss. Aran, his senses dulled by the strong ale, teeters on the edge of recklessness, while Hyrne, always the stealthy observer, watches the surroundings with sharp eyes. Galivan, the steady hand, seeks to understand the deeper currents at play, attempting to discern truth from deception.

As the group gathers their wits in the village square, the mood is tense. The villagers are a mix of suspicion and fear. Mrs Pollmor, the elder, stands at the center of this tension, her gang of allies flanking her. Her presence is a stark reminder that in the Hollows, alliances are as fickle as the winds.

### A Whispered Decision

When Vike, the enigmatic gamekeeper, suggests a meeting at the old graveyard, the group is forced to make a quick decision. The implication is clear—they must go now, leaving behind the safety of the crowd and entering a place that breathes death. The suggestion to split the party is debated, with Bomtom’s wry humour failing to disguise his concern: “We’re either walking into something above board, or we’re gonna get shanked.”

The decision is made to send Hyrne ahead, his skills in stealth and scouting making him the natural choice. The plan is simple—Hyrne would scout the area, while Bomtom, Aran, and Galivan would follow a few minutes later, under the guise of drunken revellers. This is a calculated risk, but in the Hollows, risks are all they have.

### The Graveyard’s Embrace

The old graveyard is as they left it—quiet, eerie, and oppressive even in daylight. As Hyrne melts into the shadows, moving from tombstone to tombstone, the atmosphere shifts. The noise of the festival fades into the background, becoming a distant echo. Even the birds refuse to sing in this place. The sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows that stretch like fingers reaching out to snatch the unwary.

As Hyrne scouts the graveyard, Bomtom and Galivan discuss the potential outcomes with Aran, whose bravado is starting to wane. They are painfully aware that the graveyard is the perfect place for an ambush. Yet, their resolve is strong—they’ve come this far, and they will see it through.

Hyrne’s scouting reveals nothing overly suspicious. The sealed tomb they had encountered before remains undisturbed, and there is no sign of anyone else nearby. But the feeling of unease grows, gnawing at his senses. He knows that the graveyard hides its secrets well, and what cannot be seen may still pose the greatest danger.

### The Flames of Betrayal

Back in the village, Bomtom’s keen ears catch the sound of a commotion. Smoke rises from beyond the rooftops, and the distant sound of revelry has morphed into something more sinister. Bomtom nudges the others—“The village is on fire.” The words hang in the air, heavy with implication.

As they return to the village, the scene they encounter is one of chaos. The villagers are in a frenzy, scrambling to put out a fire that rages along the riverfront. Three of Yawim’s prized brewing boats are engulfed in flames, their fiery demise reflecting the rapidly deteriorating situation in the village. The joy of the festival is gone, replaced by panic and anger.

Mrs Pollmor stands on the bridge, her composed demeanour in stark contrast to the chaos around her. She watches the blaze with an unreadable expression, her mind undoubtedly turning over the possibilities. To Bomtom, it is clear—someone wants the village divided, and they are succeeding.

Vike’s implication in the arson becomes a point of contention. The discovery of a dagger near the burning boats only adds fuel to the fire. When Galivan identifies it as the one sold to the blacksmith, a sense of dread settles over the group. This is no ordinary dagger—its presence is a clear attempt to frame them. They are being played, and they know it.

### The Confrontation on the Bridge

With the village on edge, Sturkas—the towering, imposing figure of authority—arrives to take control of the situation. His deep voice cuts through the noise as he demands answers. The villagers look to him for guidance, their fear palpable. The group finds themselves under suspicion, their every move scrutinised.

In a bold move, Bomtom brings Perko into the fold. The mute, simple-minded villager has seen something—of that, Bomtom is sure. His trust in Perko’s honesty is unwavering, despite Mrs Pollmor’s dismissive attitude. Sturkas, however, is not so easily swayed by Palmore’s scorn. He knows the value of a witness, even one as unassuming as Perko.

Perko’s silent testimony, his nodding head confirming that Vike was indeed the arsonist, sends a ripple through the crowd. Sturkas, ever the pragmatist, recognizes the truth in Perko’s simple gestures. He wastes no time in ordering Palmore’s removal, effectively ending her influence over the village. The villagers, seeing their elder disgraced, begin to distance themselves from her, their loyalty shifting.

Yawim, now vindicated, approaches the group with an offer of thanks. His earlier suspicion of them is gone, replaced by a genuine sense of gratitude. He invites them to meet at the Three Skulls tavern, where they can discuss the future in a more controlled environment.

### The Offer of Leadership

Night falls over the Hollows, and the mood in the Three Skulls is somber. The events of the day weigh heavily on everyone, but there is also a sense of relief. Yawim joins them, still smelling of smoke, and speaks plainly. He apologises for doubting them and extends his hand in friendship. But more than that, he asks for their support in his bid to become the new village elder.

The group agrees—Yawim’s vision for the Hollows aligns with their own. He promises to rebuild the boats and make the village a hub of trade and commerce. In return, he asks for their backing when the time comes to vote for the new leader. They accept, knowing that this alliance will serve them well in the future.

### The Journey Downriver

Three days pass, and the group finds themselves on the river, their destination: Dark End. The journey is peaceful, a welcome respite from the tension of the Hollows. The river winds through marshlands, teeming with life. Strange creatures dart in and out of the water, their movements barely perceptible beneath the murky surface. Birds of prey circle overhead, their cries echoing across the water.

As they draw closer to Dark End, the landscape changes. The village is nothing like the Hollows—it is prosperous, bustling with activity, and heavily fortified. Tall watchtowers rise above the water, and the village is surrounded by a spiked palisade. This is a place of importance, and its strategic value is clear.

The guards at the gate are wary but professional. They direct the group to the town hall, instructing them to register before exploring the village. As they step onto the wooden walkways, they are acutely aware of the differences between Dark End and the Hollows. Here, the air is thick with the promise of opportunity, but also the potential for danger.

### Dark End: A New Beginning

Dark End is a village on the rise, a place where the group can find new allies and new challenges. The people here are industrious, the militia well-armed and disciplined. The village’s strategic location on the river makes it a hub of trade, and its defences suggest that it has faced and withstood numerous threats.

As they prepare to make their way to the town hall, the group senses that their journey is far from over. Dark End is a place of secrets, and they are determined to uncover them. But for now, they must tread carefully, for they are strangers in a land that holds both promise and peril.
