The silence on the mountainside was profound, broken only by the wind whistling over the field of grotesque, slaughtered Misgrown. The companions stood over the body of the fallen Redrunner, the chaotic psychic storm of his last moments still raging in their minds. His legacy, a worn leather satchel, was now theirs. Within, they found his journal and a torn piece of a map, the final testaments of a failed quest they had unknowingly inherited.

Passing the blood-stained pages between them, they pieced together the grim truth of their new reality. The journal spoke not of treasure, but of a desperate struggle to stop a genocide. The "elven rubies" were no mere gems; they were the very souls of the First Elves, being harvested and cracked open like nuts by the monstrous sorcerer-god, Zytera, to fuel the creation of her flesh-crafted army. Each Misgrown they had seen was animated by the ghost of a murdered kinsman. For Hearn, the description of these birthing pits was a deeply unsettling, triggering echo of the horrors he had witnessed in the Amalgamate's lair.

The Redrunner's words painted a map of their potential future, laying out two paths of profound danger. One entry described the **Vale of the Dead**, a desecrated sanctuary to the north in the lands of Vivend. It was a place of immense spiritual power, tainted by Zygofer's old rot but holding the only promise of mending their own fractured souls. The other path led to the cursed fortress of **Weatherstone**, a "cancer on the land" where the undead King Algarod held court, a puppet to Zytera's will, and the birthing pit from which the Misgrown, including the very beast that scarred Hearn, crawled forth.

The final, hastily scrawled entry confirmed their fears. The Redrunner had been hunted by intelligent, spider-like trackers, agents of Zytera who were closing in as he died. He had felt the light of the ruby Iridne nearby, but the darkness was calling to its own.

As they absorbed the weight of this knowledge, Aran noticed a subtle shift. The sounds of the wild—the cry of an eagle, the clatter of a mountain goat—began to return, as if the land itself was breathing a sigh of relief. The peace was short-lived. A shrill, insect-like buzz of a hunting horn echoed from the slopes above, bouncing off the valley walls. It was answered by another from the forest to the east. Instantly, the wilderness fell silent once more. They were being flanked. High on the ridges, they saw them: multi-limbed, arachnid figures, scuttling over sheer rock with unnatural speed. Zytera's hunters had found them.

A frantic escape began. They scrambled down a treacherous scree slope toward the river below. The terrain, which should have been simple for seasoned adventurers, proved a nightmare for their fractured abilities. Torvin landed with a jarring thud that sent pain shooting up his spine. Gallivan, faltering at the top, was nearly struck by a poison dart from a hunter's blowpipe before tumbling clumsily down the slope. Hearn, his legendary grace eluding him, felt clumsy and heavy-footed, his connection to the wild severed, though he made it down unharmed.

They reached the fast-flowing river, their only path to escape the closing net. They plunged into the freezing water, fighting the current. Torvin, weighed down by his armor and grim determination, nearly exhausted himself in the crossing. Aran, a creature of the forest, flailed in the water like a cat in a bath. But they made it. On the far bank, they looked back to see the spider-hunters halting their pursuit at the water's edge, their quarry lost.

They were alive, but soaked, freezing, and utterly spent. Pressing north along the river, their brief sense of security was again shattered by a foul stench—a lair. Though tempted to clear it and claim shelter, their caution won out. A little further on, another strange omen: a massive, speckled egg, twice the size of a watermelon, lay in a hastily dug pit. After a series of spectacularly failed attempts to identify it, with the three would-be masters of the wild utterly baffled by the object, they decided to leave the mystery undisturbed before its mother returned.

As dusk fell, they finally made camp. It was a miserable affair, a testament to their weakened state. Their attempts to rest were failures, leaving them cold and sleepy. As they shivered through a long night, the very same armored automaton they had encountered once before, the rusty knight of legend, emerged from the forest. It stood motionless, staring at them for a long moment before turning and stomping back into the darkness, leaving them to their unease. The sight broke Torvin's fragile composure, sending him into a state of confused panic that required Aran’s tainted magic to mend, a process that healed his wits but wiped the last hour from his memory.

The next day, weary and on edge, they pushed on. In the distance, they saw the welcome sign of civilization: smoke rising from chimneys. Following the river, they arrived at the gates of a village. This was Upper Copperham. The settlement was larger than most they had seen, yet a strange listlessness clung to it. The people were sullen, the buildings seemed to sag with a premature rot, and over every door was a spiraling, seven-pointed sigil of demonic origin. In the center of the square, where a well should be, stood a single, dark stone pillar.

Seeking refuge, they were directed to the Second Dog Inn. The place was as grim as the village itself. The beer was watered-down piss, and the few patrons were downtrodden and silent. The only spark of joy was a large, friendly mastiff who greeted them warmly. They cooked the last of their foraged food over the inn's meager fire and were shown to a shared room. Exhausted, they collapsed into straw beds, one of which was already occupied by a large, flatulent man, snoring obliviously in the dark. They had found sanctuary, of a sort, but had traded the dangers of the wild for a place steeped in its own quiet, unsettling mystery.
