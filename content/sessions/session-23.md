The world had been scrubbed clean. Emerging from the blood, filth, and suffocating darkness of the cult's heart, the companions found themselves atop a forgotten tower gate, bathed in the golden light of a new dawn. Before them stretched a vast, pristine wilderness, a paradise of rolling plains and distant peaks, untouched by the corruption they had left behind in the west. For a fleeting, glorious moment, they had won.

But victory had come at a terrible cost. As the adrenaline of their impossible survival faded, a chilling realization took hold. The Amalgamate's final, explosive death cry was not merely a shower of gore, but a psychic and magical scouring. The chaotic essence of the creature had washed through them, and while they lived, their connection to their own power—to magic, to instinct, to their very nature—was left fractured, unreliable, and dangerously wild. They were weaker than they had ever been, standing at the edge of a world they were no longer equipped to face.

The descent from the tower was a perilous, scrambling affair down a treacherous scree slope. At the bottom, they found a small river, its water so clear and full of life it seemed a memory from a different world. It was the first clean water they had seen in months, and they drank deeply, the simple act a profound relief. With midday approaching, they made a makeshift camp. Torvin, his mind and body still reeling from the horror and his Nocturnal curse, collapsed into an exhausted rest. Gallivan managed to catch a fish, and Aran foraged a bounty of edible vegetables. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, they had a full meal.

Their respite, however, was short-lived. The first sign that the scouring had left a deeper wound came when Aran laid his hands on Torvin to mend the last of his injuries. The spell worked, knitting flesh and bone, but in a way that horrified the elf. Where his magic was once pure and seamless, it was now crude, rudimentary, and tainted. The wounds closed, but left behind messy, gnarled scars, as if stitched together with horsehair. Something fundamental within him was broken.

As dusk settled, Gallivan’s attempt to make a proper camp failed. Pushing his luck, he tried again, but the effort backfired, unleashing a wave of misfortune that settled upon Aran in the form of a maddening lice infestation, leaving him unable to rest. In a scene that bordered on grim comedy, Torvin, freshly healed but still anxious, subjected Aran to a frantic "healing" by repeatedly dunking him in the freezing river until the parasites were washed away.

Later that night, while Torvin kept a sleepless watch, Hyrne slipped into the darkened woods. His hunt was successful, returning with a fox—three portions of precious meat and a pelt, a small victory in their desperate state.

The next morning, they pressed on, following the river north. The idyllic peace was shattered when they spotted a misshapen wooden shield bobbing in the current, followed minutes later by a severed arm, leaving a pale trail of blood in the clear water. The grim discovery led them to a grim scene: a wide, marshy grassland littered with the bodies from a recent, savage battle.

The dead were not men, not entirely. They were misshapen horrors—limbs fused together, skin stretched over scaly plates, some bearing the claws of a crab. In the center of this carnage stood a lone, hooded figure, slumped over a staff and impaled by a crude bone spear. As they approached, the figure looked up, revealing the noble, pointed features of an elf. Aran recognized him instantly, not by his face, but by the red, five-pointed star clasping his cloak. He was a Redrunner, one of the legendary elven warriors sworn to hunt evil across the Forbidden Lands.

Mortally wounded, the elf beckoned them closer. With his dying breath, he whispered a fragmented, desperate warning:

"They have it... the heart-stone... Iridne. Zytera sees... the spider feels every tremor in its web. You... your scent... you reek of its lesser kin. Warn the others. The four rubies... Stanengist."

As his life fled, a psychic clap of energy erupted from his body, slamming into the minds of the companions and plunging them into a shared, chaotic nightmare. They were assaulted by a montage of terrifying visions: a crumbling fortress called **Weatherstone**, where a skeletal king sat on a throne, his hand gripping a sword that pulsed with dark power; a misty, ghost-filled valley known as the **Vale of the Dead**, where a one-eyed giant wept in sorrow and a latent power promised the only hope of healing their fractured spirits; a dark, subterranean laboratory where the very beast that had scarred Hyrne was born from a vat of gore; and finally, through the Redrunner's own eyes, they saw the twisted obsidian fortress of **Alderstone** and the monstrous, spider-legged sorcerer-god, **Zytera**. As the vision ended, her voice scraped across their minds, a promise and a threat:

**"Little sparks. You extinguished my failed copy. Now you have my attention."**

The vision shattered, leaving them gasping on the blood-soaked field. The Redrunner was gone. Searching his body, they found his journal, filled with lore of the elven rubies and the quest to defeat Zytera, along with a torn map. On it were two marked locations: Weatherstone and the Vale of the Dead.

They had survived the horrors beneath the mountains only to inherit the quest of a dying hero. They were weakened, lost in a strange new land, and had earned the attention of a god. The true journey had just begun.
