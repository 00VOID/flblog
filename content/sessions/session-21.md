The stale air of the skull-lined ossuary still clung to their new ceremonial robes, but a fresh resolve settled over Torvin, Hearn, Gallivan, and Aran. The cryptic parchment hinting at "four directions" and "guided needles" had become their lodestar, promising passage to the Chapel of Blood’s Heart. With two compass-statues already located, their quest now centered on finding the remaining two.

Exiting the macabre chamber, they turned left, advancing along the long corridor they had previously scouted. At its furthest end, the path diverged. Instead of the descent, they chose the room ahead, finding what appeared to be an ancient **study**. A dusty desk stood in one corner, and at the back, a raised platform bore three tall, imposing cupboards. The central one immediately drew their attention, marked by a distinct circular indentation.

Torvin attempted to open it, but the doors remained stubbornly shut, rattling slightly but refusing to budge. Hearn, ever meticulous, examined the two flanking cupboards; both were empty, their dusty shelves offering no secrets. The desk, too, was bare save for a broken stool, suggesting a long-abandoned space. Gallavan then remembered the **gold disc** salvaged from the curious globe puzzle. With a collective nod, he offered it. It slipped almost perfectly into the circular recess on the central cupboard, a faint, almost imperceptible hum accompanying its placement. With a soft click, the cupboard doors eased open a fraction.

A sudden, sharp _whirr_ and a _thwack_ echoed in the small room as a dart shot out from the barely open cupboard, embedding itself in the wall opposite. Their cautious positioning had saved them, as no one had stood directly in front of the trap. With the initial danger passed, the doors swung fully open, revealing a single, rolled-up piece of **parchment** on the bottom shelf. Gallavan carefully retrieved it, its old writing faded but legible. He read aloud, his voice low, the words echoing slightly in the confined space:

> _Of the celestial alignments, know this Seeker of truths:_  _The **Law Master**, whose wisdom guides the mind to the point of greatest illumination, charts the course for all enlightenment._  _The **Hearth Keeper**, guardian of warmth and hearth, welcomes the first light that banishes the chill, binding all within its embrace._  _The **Wanderer**, ever seeking new horizons, travels towards the deepest shadow cast by the sun's highest ascent, where journeys truly begin._  _And the **Sentinel**, ever vigilant, defends the realm from the fading glow of day, guarding the secrets of the night._

The words resonated with their earlier discoveries, confirming their suspicions. “The Law Master, the scholar with the star map,” Torvin confirmed, his voice rough. “’Greatest illumination’ implies noon, the sun at its zenith.”

“And the Hearth Keeper, with his brazier, welcoming ‘first light’… that has to be dawn, or East,” Hearn mused, picturing the smiling statue in the ossuary, its brazier a symbol of warmth and new beginnings. The remaining two, the Wanderer and the Sentinel, were still mysteries to be fully deciphered, but their purpose was clear: these were the clues to aligning the compasses.

Their next exploration led them to a blood-smeared wooden door in a meeting chamber off the main corridor. The air here was heavy with the lingering scent of incense, mixed with something else, something indefinable and unsettling. Benches lined one side of the chamber, and a large, closed wooden door, with what looked like dried blood smeared across its surface, stood to the south.

Torvin, despite the chilling aura that emanated from the door, cautiously tried the latch. It clanked, a surprisingly loud sound in the oppressive silence, and the door swung open to a horrific sight.

This was no ordinary chamber, but a **chapel of desecration**. Pews, overturned and broken, lay scattered across a floor stained with dark, viscous residue, leading to a blood-soaked altar. Grotesque murals, daubed with splashes of blood and unspeakable remains, covered the walls, depicting scenes of torture and sacrifice that turned the stomach. A pile of skeletal detritus, clearly human, lay at the altar’s foot, picked clean. And standing amidst this horror, on the platform before the altar, was an **armored undead figure** – a mummy or zombie, its decaying plate armor clanking softly with its slow movements. It clutched a defaced religious effigy, its features twisted in a silent scream. As the door opened, it slammed its staff to the ground, a thunderous boom echoing through the chapel, and raised a bony, accusatory finger at Torvin. Behind it, in an alcove, stood another **large statue**—the third compass-statue.

Torvin, ever the warrior, didn’t hesitate. “Die!” he roared, charging at the undead horror, leaping heroically over the overturned pews. His shield met the mummy’s unyielding form with a sickening crunch, but the creature merely absorbed the blow, standing motionless and unyielding. Its eyes flared with an unholy, malevolent light, and an ancient, hungry rage tore at the adventurers' souls, a palpable psychic assault. It retaliated, striking with an unseen force that dealt three points of Wits damage to Torvin, leaving him broken, his mind reeling, paralyzed by a crippling fear that rooted him to the spot.

Combat raged. Aran’s arrows pinged harmlessly off the mummy’s armor, failing to find a purchase. Gallavan moved into the room, his hand already glowing with arcane energy, assessing the situation. The mummy, its movements slow and deliberate, shuffled towards the door, focused entirely on the incapacitated Torvin, letting out guttural, raspy noises that were more death-rattle than speech. Gallavan, observing the creature’s movements, recalled a crucial piece of lore: these undead were often "location-locked," their power fading if drawn from their consecrated ground. A desperate plan formed: **kite the mummy out of the chapel**.

Aran, with precise shots, kept the mummy's attention, drawing it away from the altar and towards the doorway. As it shuffled across the chapel's threshold and into the corridor, its power visibly diminished. The green specters it had begun to manifest in the room faded, dissolving into the gloom, and dust began to fall from its decaying plate armor, leaving faint trails on the stone floor. Torvin, regaining just enough composure due to Aran's persistent healing magic, managed to escape the chapel, his legs still shaky. Hearn and Gallavan also retreated, maintaining a safe distance, watching the slow, inexorable pursuit.

The mummy, now disoriented and weakened outside its sanctum, eventually shuffled to a closed door in the corridor and simply stopped, unable to process the barrier. It stood there, a silent, decaying sentinel, its back to them. Seizing the moment, Torvin, now free from its immediate presence and with a surge of renewed fury, delivered a final, furious blow to its back with his battle axe. The ancient being crumbled, its plate armor clattering loudly to the floor in a cloud of dust and noxious air. A rush of putrid air escaped its form as it became inert, a lifeless pile of bone and rusted metal. From its remains, they recovered ten silver coins in a moldy pouch.

With the mummy vanquished, Hearn emerged from his hiding place and entered the gruesome chapel. He approached the statue in the alcove. It depicted a cloaked and hooded figure, staff firmly grasped, gazing off into a distant horizon, as if perpetually searching. This was clearly the **Wanderer**. Following the clue "travels towards the deepest shadow cast by the sun's highest ascent," Hearn cautiously turned its compass to the **West**, the direction of the setting sun and longest shadows, feeling a subtle click as the needle locked into place.

Before moving on, they discreetly checked the unmolested coffins in the south corridor, but found nothing of interest within, leaving the silent dead to their undisturbed rest.

Finally, they advanced to the eastern door at the main corridor's crossroad. A faint shuffling sound could be heard from within. As Hearn and Aran cautiously opened it, they were greeted by two more shuffling, hooded figures – animated corpses, thankfully oblivious to their presence, seemingly due to their newly donned robes. Their movements were slow, aimless, a perpetual, silent patrol.

At the room's northern wall stood the last statue: a **soldier** in a vigilant, armed pose, its shield emblazoned with a single unblinking eye and a spear at the ready. This was the **Sentinel**, whose clue described it as "defending the realm from the fading glow of day, guarding the secrets of night." Like the others, a compass was set into its plinth. In the center of the room, a massive pillar comprised of six gigantic, stacked blocks hinted at a central mechanism or a hidden passage, its purpose still unclear.

All four compass-statues had now been found: the Law Master, the Hearth Keeper, the Wanderer, and the Sentinel. The ancient riddle was complete, and the pieces of the puzzle lay before them. The time for deciphering the precise alignment of the "guided needles" to the "calling void" was at hand, but the exhausting ordeal had left them drained. Torvin, in particular, suffered from his new critical injury, unable to truly rest in the perpetual gloom of the underground. A true rest, if such a thing were possible in these cursed depths, was sorely needed before they could attempt to unlock the Chapel of Blood’s Heart.
