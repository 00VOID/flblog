###  The Approach – An Omen on the Wind

The air grew noticeably colder as the weary travelers approached the mist-laden lake. A biting wind whipped across the steely surface, carrying with it a silence that felt unnatural. No birds sang. No insects buzzed. Even the rustling of the skeletal trees seemed muted, swallowed by an unseen force.
Before them, looming against the ashen sky, stood Khelgar’s Keep. It was a monolith of dark stone and heavy timber, its four stories rising like a watchtower against the wilderness. Narrow windows, black as the void, stared out like hungry eyes, and creeping vines clawed up the walls, twisting between patches of grey-green lichen. No lights burned within. No smoke curled from the chimneys. The place stood in eerie solitude, its presence heavy with an unspoken dread.
As they pressed forward, their boots crunching against the frost-kissed ground, a battered wooden sign caught their attention.
The plank was old, warped by time and the elements, but the lettering was fresh. The paint had only just begun to dull beneath the harsh weather. The words had been scrawled in a rushed, almost frantic hand, thick strokes carving out the message:

**"BEWARE. TURN BACK. KHELGAR'S KEEP."**

The wind groaned through the trees, the sign creaking ominously, as if pleading with them to heed its warning.

Torvin snorted, tightening his grip on the reins of his steed. "Bit late for that."

Aran’s eyes narrowed. "Someone wanted this message read, and not long ago."

Hyrne knelt, pressing a gloved hand against the damp, churned earth beneath the sign. "No footprints. Whoever left it is long gone."

Galivan’s voice was grim. "But gone where?"

A stillness settled over the group as they exchanged uneasy glances. The only way to find out was to press on.

### The Outbuildings – Echoes of the Past

The keep’s smaller structures stood in various states of decay. Their frames sagged under years of neglect, their timbers warped and brittle.

### The Smokehouse – A Warning in the Ashes

The smokehouse was little more than a shell, its roof half-collapsed, the fire pit long cold. The scent of smoked meat still clung to the air, stubborn despite the years, but something darker tainted the aroma—iron and rot.

Aran scoured the interior, his boots kicking up soot. His fingers brushed against something hidden beneath a loose stone, brittle with age. A scrap of parchment, its edges charred.

He lifted it carefully, brushing away the blackened flakes. Only one word remained, written in a desperate, unsteady hand.

"Trapped."

The word settled over them like a lead weight.

### The Stables – A Forgotten Mark

The stables were empty—no horses, no movement, only the lingering scent of leather and damp hay. Yet it was not abandoned.

Torvin’s gaze caught a glint of silver in the dim light. A saddle, polished and untouched by time, hung upon a wooden peg. The craftsmanship was exquisite, the leather embossed with a stylized wolf’s head within a triangle.

His fingers traced the crest. "Not just a wolf…" he murmured. "This means something."

Gallivan stepped closer, his expression dark. "It’s a symbol of darkness. Predatory. It might be connected to the Nightwalker."

Torvin’s smirk barely concealed his unease. "Well, it’s mine now."

### The Boathouse – Death in the Dark

The boathouse stood by the lake, its doors ajar, the scent of fish and stagnant water heavy in the air. Torvin was the first inside, his steps slow, cautious.

There was no boat.

Only silence.

His boot scuffed against something hard beneath a pile of reeds and broken planks. He crouched, shifting the debris aside.

A skull stared back at him.

The bone was smooth, its surface bleached, yet strands of dark hair still clung to its base. A jagged crack split the forehead, a wound from something violent.

Torvin swallowed.

"We’re not alone here," he muttered.

### The Keep – A Shadowed Welcome

The main doors of Khelgar’s Keep were massive, built of thick oak and reinforced with iron bands. They were unlocked, yet they did not open easily. It took two of them—Torvin and Hyrne—forcing their weight against the wood before the hinges finally screeched in protest, the sound echoing into the gloom.

Inside, the air was frigid, thick with dust and decay. The Great Hall stretched before them, its high-beamed ceiling shrouded in cobwebs, its long tables left untouched by time.

Yet, among the abandoned plates and overturned chairs, one thing stood out.

By the cold hearth, resting upon an ornate wooden stand, lay a large, leather-bound tome.

Galivan stepped forward.

### The Hunting Journal – Khelgar’s Descent

The journal was thick, its cover worn and cracked, but the pages were surprisingly well-preserved.

Galivan flipped through them, his brow furrowing. The words began calm, orderly, recounting the hunts of a renowned hunter.

But as he turned the pages, the writing shifted. The lines grew erratic, unhinged.

_"Something watches me from the trees."_

_"It moves between the shadows. Not a wolf. Not a man."_

_"It calls to me in my dreams. Its hunger is my hunger."_

_"Gods help me… the seal is breaking."_

Galivan’s fingers tightened on the page.

And then, a whisper drifted through the hall.

Hyrne froze.

### The Ghost Wolf – A Warning from the Abyss

The stairs creaked beneath his weight as Hyrne ascended, the shadows deepening around him. He had almost reached the second floor when—

A shape emerged from the darkness.

A wolf, massive and ethereal, its form swirling like mist, its eyes burning with ember-light.

It watched him, unmoving, unblinking.

A growl rumbled through the air, but its mouth never moved.

Then—it was gone.

Hyrne’s breath came ragged, his heart hammering against his ribs. He turned sharply, descending the stairs without a word.

It was still here.

### The Trapdoor & Elara’s Plea

The fire in the kitchen had burned low, flickering against the stone walls.

Then—a sound.

The trapdoor swung open.

A woman staggered forth, her clothes tattered, her eyes wide with exhaustion.

Torvin’s sword was at her throat in an instant. "Who the hell are you?"

She flinched, raising her hands. "No! Please!"

Aran stepped forward, placing a firm hand on Torvin’s arm. "Easy. Let’s hear her out."

The woman swallowed hard, her voice trembling. "My name is Elara… and you must leave before it’s too late."

### The Ritual – Banishment or Damnation

While the others descended, Galivan remained. His eyes scanned the final entry in the journal.

_"A shadow cannot be slain. Only banished."_

_"If the seal is broken… it will return."_

The truth settled like a stone in his gut.

The Wolfshadow had possessed Khelgar, twisting him into something monstrous. The ritual—the only way to free him—was dangerous. It required a consecrated weapon, an incantation, and most of all…

Khelgar had to be willing.

A whisper drifted through the hall, curling around him.

And beneath them, in the shadows of the keep, something stirred.
