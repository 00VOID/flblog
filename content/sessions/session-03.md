In the dimly lit tavern, the group of adventurers, known individually as Bomtom, Aran, Hyrne, and Galivan, sat around a rustic table, their faces illuminated by the flickering light of a nearby hearth. The evening had been eventful, and the air was thick with the scent of wood smoke and the chatter of villagers.

The adventurers found themselves in the Dead Man’s Hand, a tavern known for its eerie atmosphere. They had earlier encountered Perko, a simpleton who had given them a dead bird, a gesture that seemed innocent but potentially held deeper meaning. As they discussed their next moves, the conversation turned to the old cemetery, a place whispered about with fear and fascination. It was rumoured to be haunted by restless spirits, and the group speculated on the possibility of finding clues or hidden treasures within its confines.

As the night wore on, the group noticed a figure entering the tavern, a cloaked man with a lute slung across his back. The haunting melody he played seemed to seep into the very walls of the tavern, unsettling the adventurers. The figure, upon closer inspection, was revealed to be a skeletal bard, doomed to wander and play his mournful tune for eternity. This encounter left Galivan shaken, a stark reminder of the perils that lay in wait in the Raven Lands.

The following morning, the adventurers, guided by Sturkas, made their way to the residence of Mrs. Pollmore. The elder’s house, once grand, now stood as a testament to the village’s slow decline, its beams carved with intricate designs now overgrown with moss and ivy. Inside, the house was cluttered with papers and books, a chaotic repository of the village’s history.

Mrs. Pollmore welcomed them with a wary eye, eager to share her side of the story in the brewing conflict with Brewmaster Yawim. She painted Yawim as a greedy opportunist, eager to expand his trade beyond the village at the expense of the community’s harmony. The adventurers listened, absorbing the information, but remained cautious, aware that there were always multiple sides to every story in the Raven Lands.

Leaving Mrs. Pollmore’s house, the group debated their next course of action. The docks, where Yawim’s trade boats were moored, seemed a logical place to gather more information.

The group decided to explore the docks further, assessing the feasibility of sabotaging Yawim’s boats as suggested by Mrs. Pollmor. However, they were reluctant to take such drastic action without more information. Instead, they planned to gather more intelligence, hoping to find a solution that wouldn’t embroil them in the village’s internal conflicts.

The wooden jetty stretched out into the river, lined with barrels of ale ready for transport. As they surveyed the scene, the adventurers noticed Perko again, this time pretending to fish. Despite his simple demeanour, it was clear Perko was more observant than he let on, his eyes tracking everything around him.

Aran approached Perko, who responded by drawing a smiley face and an arrow pointing towards the adventurers, a silent acknowledgment of their presence and perhaps a gesture of goodwill.

The group then made their way to the cottage of Nirvea, the village midwife and healer. Her home was a quaint, rustic structure, surrounded by herbs and adorned with animal bones and feathers. The air was thick with the scent of wood smoke and medicinal herbs. Inside, Nirvea welcomed them warmly, offering nettle tea and cautioning them about the mushrooms growing around her home.

Nirvea spoke of the restless dead, confirming that the old cemetery was indeed a place of unease. She hinted at a deeper history involving a cursed count and an evil wizard, a tale that seemed to intertwine with the village’s own dark past. The adventurers, intrigued, decided to return the next day for more information, hoping Nirvea’s books and scrolls might shed light on the mysteries they sought to unravel.

As they left Nirvea’s cottage, the group considered their options. The brewing conflict between Mrs. Pollmor and Brewmaster Yawim seemed to be a focal point, but there were other threads to follow. The cemetery, the restless dead, and the mysterious bard all pointed to deeper secrets buried within the village’s history. The adventurers knew they needed to tread carefully, each decision potentially leading to unforeseen consequences.

Returning to the Dead Man’s Hand, the adventurers reflected on their findings. The village was a web of intrigue and danger, each thread leading to potential peril. The mention of the Raven and the Rust Brothers by Nirvea lingered in their minds, a connection they couldn’t yet fully understand but felt was crucial.

As they settled in for the night, the haunting melody of the skeletal bard echoed in their thoughts. The village of the Hollows was a place where the past and present intertwined, where the restless dead walked among the living, and where every decision could tip the balance between survival and ruin.

With dawn breaking, the adventurers knew they had to proceed with caution. They had promised to return to Nevaeh, hoping to unearth more about the count and the crypt. They also needed to decide how to handle the brewing conflict between Mrs. Pollmore and Yawim, a conflict that threatened to engulf the entire village.
